Write a Java program about banking. Kindly include the login part:

Username:
Password:
(Only set up one account unless there's a database, but that's not required for this program).

After logging in, you will have 1 million pesos in your bank account. Once logged in, you can deposit or withdraw money as long as you have funds available.

There are two options available: deposit and withdraw money.

In the deposit option, you can add any amount of money you want to deposit.

For withdrawals, there are no charges if you withdraw from the same bank which is BDO. However, if you withdraw from a different bank (other bank is the name of the other  option), there will be a 2.5% charge. 

Also, please note that the maximum amount you can withdraw is 10,000 pesos. If you are going to withdraw more than 10,000 pesos, just withdraw again it will show 10,000 pesos is the maximum amount to withdraw per transaction.
