Begin by prompting the user to enter their name, age, bus class (Class A, Class B, Ordinary), destination, and payment amount.

Then, based on the entered age, determine the appropriate age classification: 
- Ages 0-17: Minor
- Ages 18-59: Adult
- Ages 60 and above: Senior citizen (20% discount)

Next, calculate the fare based on the selected bus class and apply any applicable discounts. The fare amounts are as follows:
- Class A: 45000
- Class B: 30000
- Ordinary: 17000

After calculating the fare, check if the payment amount is sufficient. If it's more than the grand total, calculate the change. If it's insufficient, prompt the user to enter the payment amount again, displaying a message to pay the exact amount or more.
